I attach an ascii file (for each band) output from the plotting code that details the datapoints.  For completeness I've also included the breakdown 
into 'all (galaxy)', 'early-type', 'late-type' and 'starburst' as is shown (for 3.6 and 24 micron) in Fig. 9.  You probably just want the galaxy LF 
data (as in Fig. 8) but the breakdown may be of interest if you're looking at environments (ie. expect more early-type in clusters etc).  Apologies 
for the slightly unfriendly format! 

[aside - I haven't included the quasar/AGN LFs here]

Looking at the left column if Fig 9, each file first details the first panel - 'galaxies', moving through each redshift bin (bin 0 is 0<z<0.25, bin 1 
is 0.25<z<0.5, bin 2 us 0.5<z<1.0, bin 3 is 1<z<1.5, bin 4 is 1.5<z<2), then the early-type panel, late-type, and starbursts.  Note that there is no 
redshift bin 4 data for the early- or late-types (1.5<z<2).

Format - here is an example (the first z bin for the galaxy 3.6 micron LF):

Explanation:
First line - band (3.6 micron)
Second line - redshift bin
Third line - the luminosity (x axis) values
4th line - LF (y axis) values
5th line - LF up.  ADD to LF value to get the upper value
6th line - LF done.  SUBTRACT from LF value to get the lower error bar.  If value is same as on 4th line then subtraction =0 i.e its an upper limit.

Shout if anything doesn't make sense/seems to be incorrect (plotting should give you the same as Fig 8 unless I'v made an error preparing these 
files!).

Cheers,
Tom

PS since someone else asked me about H, h H0 etc here's a brief recap of what I used in the paper -
I used H0=72 (lambda=0.7) in calculations. In the plotting (since h is more traditional and to aid comparisons), I used the traditional h (ie. based 
on H0=100) so needed to shift my data by 0.72^2 and 1/0.72^3 for x and y.  I did similar corrections for other data (eg Shupe et al was 0.75, 
Perez-Gonzalez was 0.7 etc) so could all be compared on same plots.
By the way, the published Fig 12 comparing the 24 micron galaxy LF to other work had a plotting error that shifted the Shupe LF to the right.  The 
correct version is annoyingly in much better agreement (attached).  Just in case you try recreating some of the plots and find you can't!
