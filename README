- IDL Library
==============

In order to use the IDL routines, you need to add the following lines to
your .bashrc file (or the equivalent for other shells) :

export GALICS_PATH="~/Dev/GALICS/NewGalaxyMaker/"  # or whereever that is 
export IDL_PATH="+${GALICS_PATH}/idl/:+your_libs:<IDL_DEFAULT>"

you will also need the astron library installed.
